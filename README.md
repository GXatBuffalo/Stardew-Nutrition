## Stardew Sustainable Farming

This is a Stardew Valley mod that aims to increase complexity in the base farming mechanics, encouraging players to think beyond raw profitibility of a crop. Instead of focusing solely on profit per day, players will need to consider soil health, crop diversity, and long-term sustainability in their farming strategies.

Whether in vanilla Stardew or a modded Stardew with tons of popular crop mods, thereâ€™s often little reason to plant anything other than the most profitable crops. This mod changes that by introducing mechanics that reward diversity and careful resource management, making less-utilized crops, flowers, and other plants (and fungi) more viable.

While not a 1:1 simulation of real-world agriculture, the mod does draw inspiration from real-life parallels. In reality, you cannot endlessly extract resources from the same soil without consequences, and every crop has an environmental impact in some way. This mod aims to mirror that idea in a fun and approachable way, prompting players to think about sustainability while still enjoying the game.
